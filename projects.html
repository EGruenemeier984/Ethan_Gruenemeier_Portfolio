                    <p class="paragraph">Ever Since I was around the age of twelve I have been very interested in technology and I
                        undertook many
                        projects that have helped me develop knowledge that has made me the person I am today. Some of
                        the projects
                        that I have done in the past few years are listed to the right. My very first project that was
                        in the
                        technology field was creating a mobile application using MIT app inventor, which was created by
                        student at
                        the Massachusets Institute of Technology. I went through many tutorials to master this piece of
                        software.
                        After exploring MIT app inventor I took on my very first project, which was an app called
                        Divergent Faction
                        Scanner and Quiz. This was a very simple app that was inspired by the Divergent books/movies of
                        which were
                        very popular at the time. This was the first app that I published to the Google Play Store and
                        as of now it
                        has over 50,000 downloads! This project was truly the moment I realized that I loved to program
                        and to
                        create things such as mobile appplications. From here on I continue to explore more in depth
                        the world of programming as well as coding. Just a couple of months after publishing the app I
                        took many online courses on Raspberry Pi computer boards. These boards are very small but super
                        capable, so one of the first projects I did with a Raspberry Pi was creating a LED lighting
                        sequence using the programming language python. I created a sequence of LEDs by soldering them
                        together and connected them to the Raspberry PI and wrote a simple Python script that
                        controlled how the lights lit up depending on time. </p>

                        <dt>Divergent Faction Scanner App</dt>
                        <dd>This was an app that "Scanned" your finger and told you your faction from the Divergent
                            Books</dd>
                        <dt>LED Lights Sequencing</dt>
                        <dd>This was a sequence of LEDs that were controlled by a python script</dd>
                        <dt>Motion Sensor Laughing Teddy Bear</dt>
                        <dd>This was another Raspberry PI project that used a mothin sensor to trigger a python script
                            to play an audio file of a laughing noise.</dd>
                        <dt>Raspberry Pi Gameboy</dt>
                        <dd>This was a gameboy made using a raspberry pi and 3d printed parts. Emulates old NES, SNES,
                            and etc. games.</dd>
                        <dt>3d Printer Upgrade</dt>
                        <dd>This was an upgrade of my 3d printer I did which consisted of tearing out the old
                            motherboard and creating my own out a RAMPS 1.4 board and a arduino.</dd>
